Experience
----------

**Your Most Recent Work Experience:**

Short text containing the type of work done, results obtained,
lessons learned and other remarks. Can also include lists and
links:

* First item

* Item with [link](http://www.example.com). Links will work both in
  the html and pdf versions.

**That Other Job You Had**

Also with a short description.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**
