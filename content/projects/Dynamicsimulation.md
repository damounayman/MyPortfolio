The dynamic simulation of two robots abb irb 6640 and abb irb 2600 in their respective working environments is presented. The dynamic simulation is ensured by ROS-Gazebo. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the importance of dynamic simulation in the design of collaborative robotic systems. In order to simulate the dynamics of an industrial robot, the dynamic parameters of the robot must be available. Since robot manufacturers do not generally provide these parameters, they must be identified. In this article, methodology for parameter identification of an industrial serial robot manipulator is shown and applied on two robots abb irb 2600 et abb irb 6640.
