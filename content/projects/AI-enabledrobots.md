# Introduction

AI-enabled robots have been a major research topic over the past decade. In the field of robot learning, the use of physical simulators is necessary before implementation on the real robot, because of sample inefficiency of learning algorithms and the cost of data collection on real world. However, the transfer of the trained model from the simulation to the real robot often fails to reproduce exactly the results obtained in simulation. In order to deal with the Sim2Real Transfer for Robotics in the context of Industry 4.0, a physical simulator was thoroughly chosen and an intelligent robotic system was implemented. To validate our framework under ROS/gazebo, tasks such as pick and place and autonomous navigation have been tested in simulation and reality. Furthermore, we interfaced our environment with OpenAI Gym in order to use state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms to train our robots.
